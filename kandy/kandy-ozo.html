About OZO Kandy
OZO Kandy is just a few minutes from the Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) and a ten-minute walk from the centre of Kandy. Guests can explore the nearby distinctive architectural structures of this UNESCO World Heritage City, which is a delightful compendium of old shops, markets and eateries. Venture outside the city to encounter the serene beauty of tea plantations, old temples and botanical gardens, all of which are hidden gems in this overwhelmingly rural country.

Nice new hotel close to lakeThe hotel is very modern and has a lovely rooftop pool and bar. Great cocktails! The room was a bit small but comfortable and nicely decorated. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Very easy to walk to lake and temple of the tooth relic. Breakfast was amazing. Would stay there again.

Ozo is a clean hotel, with a friendly and healthy staff and beautiful views from the rooftop. It's the perfect blend of walkable to downtown without being too close to the house and hustle/bustle.

Best nights rest so far.This hotel is amazing. I had to book another room for a second night because Expedia support was down. When I arrived they fixed the reservation so we could stay in the same room. The placed us near the elevator as well so I had easy access because I am on crutches. The room is so comfortable my wife and I had the best rest so far in Sri Lanka.
