New hotel - staff and restaurant not yet equal to the quality of the facility, which is first class. 1st day no hot water in the shower, but once raised, was repaired quickly. Breakfast buffet is OK; dinner buffet was awful - eat elsewhere for lunch and dinner. Staff tries hard, but still in training. Spa was very good.

It is a beautiful, modern hotel just over a kilometre away from Kandy city. The rooms are spacious and clean. The staff especially the travel desk staff are extremely helpful and always ready to assist. 
 The only drawback we had was we were given a smoking room although stated non smoking in our booking. Nonetheless we had an amazing stay.

Amazing hotel in KandyI would strongly recommend this hotel in Kandy. Amazing location, spacious rooms, very clean and with great service. One thing it could be improved is the buffet for the international guests who do not want to eat local/asian cuisine. Overall we were fully satisfied and we would like to return to this hotel.
