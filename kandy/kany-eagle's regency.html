Pros:
 Excellent quality of food with good variety, well trained staff and nice pool in Kandy. Rooms are very clean, quiet and good size. Location is handy, about 5-10min tuk tuk ride to the main attraction: the temple of the tooth. Good views.
 
 Cons:
 Spa is not the best and would not recommend as it feels fairly transactional/ is not of the same standard as rest of hotel in terms of warm welcome, cleanliness and attention to detail.
