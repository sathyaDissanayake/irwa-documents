	<h2>About The kingsbury</h2>
		<h4>In a superlative position between Colombo and the sea, this property offers an inexpensive five-star experience close to all amenities. Just a 15-minute stroll from the city center, the Ceylon Continental Hotel is elegantly furnished with clean, classic lines and offers guests seaside accommodation in close proximity to banks, shopping centers and the historical Fort and Pettah area. While many restaurants are located within walking distance, dining in the hotel offers international-standard Indian and continental dishes in a sophisticated environment. Outside on the sun terrace guests can appreciate a dramatic Sri Lankan sunset with sweeping front-row views of the Indian Ocean.</h4>

		<h4>Excellent service, great food, good location & room clean and comfortable. Staff is helpful and always ready to help. Location proximity to Dutch Hospital Shopping precinct or to most of the city. Son was sick and they made every effort to promptly provide a doctor and follow ups. Only negative is the sea view has been blocked by land reclamation but it’s not their fault. Sea front is still a walking distance south.</h4>
		<h4>Very nice hotel in the heart of Columbo. Has all the amenities. Friendly and efficient staff....service by the pool area was a bit slow though. The chinese resturante is very very good. The new roof top bar is very nice for drinks but the menus is limited. It’s also quite expensive</h4>
		<h4>Several of my family members had a reunion here. It was wonderfully arranged. Food was as usually exceptionally exuberant. The midnight walks to the Galle Face Green, the pool, and cholate snacks were wonderful. We stayed over the long weekend and also managed to have some business meeting benefiting the unique location</h4>
		<h4>I was guest in this beautifull hotel just for one night, andni want to come again. Check in was super easy and super friendly. Room was nice, with great View to the hotel pool, i slept very well. Brekfast was amazing. Excelent location.</h4>
		<h4>For a five stars hotel I found the timing of the gym very far from international standards. The staff very kind but need to be more efficient. ( Huge nbre Of staff. Need to be less and efficient) Need some change in the presentation of foods. (Same placement since a long time). You have a lot of fruits in srilanka, providing fresh juices of your local fruits will bring a huge added value to your breakfast</h4>
