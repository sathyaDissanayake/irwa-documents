About Hilton Colombo
Situated on a seven-acre plot adjoining the World Trade Center, the Hilton Colombo offers star-class service, high security and excellent views. Positioned within Colombo Fort and close to many of the city?s historical and architectural sites, the Hilton?s luxurious interiors are matched by sprawling views over the Indian Ocean and Beira Lake. Living up to the Hilton name, this hotel is swathed in plush Art Deco design, from the powder blue carpeting in the King Suites to the nouveau finishes in the lobby. While the hotel itself offers six different restaurants, its location close to Colombo?s commercial center makes access to outside shopping and dining a mere formality.
