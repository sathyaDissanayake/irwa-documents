About The Steuart By Citrus
Inspired by 175 years of heritage, the Citrus Leisure arm presents a completely new experience in the heart of Colombo.

The old ‘Steuart House’, a colonial building in Colombo 01 that housed the headquarters of George Steuart & Co. Ltd, the country’s oldest mercantile institution, was transformed into a boutique business hotel in July 2015 and aptly named The Steuart by Citrus.

This towering 8-floor Colombo city hotel boasts 50 spaciously elegant and chic guest rooms, with amenities to make your stay more than just pleasurable, with an unmistakable Scottish aura and warmth.
