About The Kingsbury
In a superlative position between Colombo and the sea, this property offers an inexpensive five-star experience close to all amenities. Just a 15-minute stroll from the city center, the Ceylon Continental Hotel is elegantly furnished with clean, classic lines and offers guests seaside accommodation in close proximity to banks, shopping centers and the historical Fort and Pettah area. While many restaurants are located within walking distance, dining in the hotel offers international-standard Indian and continental dishes in a sophisticated environment. Outside on the sun terrace guests can appreciate a dramatic Sri Lankan sunset with sweeping front-row views of the Indian Ocean.
