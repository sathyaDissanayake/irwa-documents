About Galle Face Hotel Colombo
Sri Lanka’s iconic landmark, The Galle Face Hotel, is situated in the heart of Colombo, along the seafront and facing the famous Galle Face Green. One of the oldest hotels east of the Suez, The Galle Face Hotel embraces its rich history and legendary traditions, utilizing them to create engaging, immersive experiences that resonate with old and new generations of travelers alike. No visit to Sri Lanka is complete without staying at this majestic hotel, built in 1864 and recently restored back to its former glory. 
The Galle Face Hotel swimming pool, the only salt water pool in Colombo, is private to hotel guests and is the ideal place to relax with a cool drink or swim a few laps to work out the aches and pains after a busy day in the office or exploring the city. The poolside area is a great place to sip on a cocktail and watch the sun go down.
